# DIY Bike Speedometer
Code and resources for my custom bike speedometer using an Arduino &amp; magnetic reed switch

# Files
The speedometer.ino file is the arduino code for the speedometer.
All other files are the 3d modelling files used to print the holder.

# Pin Assignments
There is an 8x2 lcd connected in a default pin arrangement (pins 12, 11, 5, 4, 3, and 2), a low battery led connected to pin 10, a button connected to pin A2, the speedometer input from the bike (magnetic reed switch) connected to pin A1, and lastly the input from the battery (LBO pin from Adafruit Powerboost 1000c) connected to pin A3.

There should be an instructable soon that will explain the construction of the PCB and bike connections in more detail. Until then, I'm sorry that this may not make much sense but I just wanted to upload this to keep this safe. Good luck with you're own project, if you are planning on making this!
